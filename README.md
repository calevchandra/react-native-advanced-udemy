React Native Advanced Course by Stephen Grider

To learn:

1) Build a Tinder-like Swipe Deck. Yes, the classic animated component!  We'll make a big stack of beautiful cards that a user can slide around the screen, swiping right to 'like' an item, or 'left' to dislike an item.  This warmup will get you familiar with interpreting touch input through the PanResponder system, moving elements around with the Animated module, and turning extrapolating animation values through the Interpolation system.

2) Dive into the backend with One Time Password authentication. Ever been prompted to sign in using a code that gets texted to you?  One Time Passwords are a new authentication flow that leverages a user's phone number as their unique identifying token.  We will use the Twilio API to send a text message to a user to verify their identity, while securing our business logic into Firebase's new Google Cloud Functions.

3) Your own Job-Search app.  Tinder for jobs! This app is is 100% feature complete!  We'll build an app with a full welcome-screen tutorial for our new user's, Facebook authentication, and map components.  The user will be presented with a list of jobs to like or dislike based on their location by leveraging Indeed's Job API, then follow up and apply to their choice jobs.
